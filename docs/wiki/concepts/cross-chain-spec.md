**`[PLANNED]` — not built, not deployed, not wired in.** The root
`README.md`'s "Decentralization path" lists cross-chain reputation
(syncing [AIS](ais.md) across Base/Arbitrum/Ethereum) as a real future
step, not a current capability. This page replaces the old wiki's
`cross-chain-spec.md`, which described a "Canonical Reputation Registry" +
"Satellite Synchronizers" design assuming the pre-rewrite singleton
`ReputationRegistry` model — that model is gone (see
[agent primitives](agent-primitives.md)), so the old design doesn't apply
as written.

## Current state: an honest, documented gap

`contracts/src/oracle/CCIPReputationBridge.sol` exists in the codebase but
is **explicitly unwired**: it predates the per-agent clone model and still
assumes one global, immutable `ReputationRegistry` — its
`registry.getAgent(agent)`/`registry.updateScoreByBridge(agent, baseScore)`
calls no longer resolve to "the" registry for an arbitrary agent, now that
every agent has its own `ReputationRegistry` clone (see
[Interface Contract §6.5](../../INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md#65-known-gap-ccipreputationbridge-is-unwired)).
It is **not** deployed by `Deploy.s.sol` and **not** referenced by
`AgentPrimitivesFactory`. Before any cross-chain sync work starts, this
contract needs reworking to resolve each agent's own `ReputationRegistry`
clone via `XibalbaAgentRegistry` on every read/write — don't build against
it as it stands today.

## What a real design would need to solve

Not built, but the shape a working version would have to address:
per-agent clone resolution (above) instead of a single hub registry;
a bridge-agnostic messaging layer (CCIP, the contract's namesake, or an
alternative) rather than vendor lock-in; a minimum confirmation delay to
mitigate bridge-reorg risk before a synced score is trusted on the
destination chain. None of this has an implementation to point at.
