# Integrity Protocol

**A trust and compliance layer for the agentic economy.** Integrity Protocol
uses smart contracts and immutable on-chain state to solve two problems no
purely off-chain system can:

1. **Regulatory compliance** — can a regulator or counterparty verify an AI
   agent's behavior *after the fact*, without trusting the agent's own word?
2. **Agent trust** — can one agent (or service) verify another's track record
   *before* transacting with it?

The protocol's defining architectural choice: **agents own and deploy their own
identity and reputation contracts.** On registration, an agent's own EVM wallet
deploys a set of *primitive* contracts that become its self-sovereign on-chain
identity. Nothing is registered *on behalf of* the agent by a privileged
factory — the deployment transactions are signed by the agent's own key, so the
chain itself is cryptographic proof of who controls what.

**Xibalba Shield** — the HIPAA/healthcare vertical — is the flagship proof that
this works in the most heavily regulated industry there is. It's not a side
feature; it's the demonstration that makes the rest of the protocol credible.

> This is a from-scratch rewrite of an earlier prototype. Its ground rule, in
> [`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`](docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md), is **no silent
> mocks**: every piece is either real and tested against a real toolchain, or an
> honestly-documented gap. Read the interface contract before changing any
> cross-package schema, port, or env var.

```

`bcc_middleware` and `integrity-oracle` together form one trust domain — the
pre-execution gate (before an agent acts) and the telemetry/scoring backend
(after an agent acts, plus all on-chain reads) — see
[`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`](docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) §6.10.

### The 7 agent primitives

Every agent, at registration, comes to own seven contracts. Two are deployed
**directly by the agent's own wallet** (so the deploy transaction proves
self-sovereign control); five are cheap **EIP-1167 minimal-proxy clones** of
shared implementation contracts (each clone is still uniquely owned and
controlled by that agent).

| # | Primitive | Deploy | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SovereignAgent` | direct | The agent's account contract — DID, cached AIS, `execute`, controller rotation |
| 2 | `StateAnchor` | direct | The agent's own tamper-evident Merkle-root anchor for its telemetry |
| 3 | `ReputationRegistry` | clone | Per-agent AIS ledger + ZK-boost bookkeeping |
| 4 | `Slasher` | clone | Per-agent $ITK stake / dispute-gated slashing vault |
| 5 | `VerifierRegistry` | clone | Per-agent versioned pointer to the ZK verifier it trusts |
| 6 | `ComplianceGate` | clone | Per-agent regulated-industry declaration + live Shield/HIPAA check |
| 7 | `AgentProfile` | clone | Per-agent domain-membership + metadata pointer |

**Call-routing rule:** every clone's admin role is granted to the agent's own
`SovereignAgent` *contract* address, never its raw EOA. All post-registration
state changes route through `SovereignAgent.execute(...)`. See
[`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`](docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) §6 for the full
convention and the one bootstrap exception.

## The Agent Integrity Score (AIS)

The protocol's trust metric. Computed in exactly one place —
`integrity-oracle/scoring-core` — and read by everyone else via the oracle's
HTTP API, never recomputed:

```
AIS = (S_entropy·wE + S_grounding·wG + S_sacrifice·wS + S_compliance·wC) · ZK_boost
```

Default weights `wE=0.30, wG=0.30, wS=0.20, wC=0.20` (sum to 1.0); `ZK_boost`
is `1.15` when a real Barretenberg proof was verified for the reporting period,
else `1.0`. The four component scores come from an agent's telemetry — the SDK
derives first-pass signals from OpenTelemetry/MLflow spans; the oracle owns the
final formula. See [`docs/wiki/concepts/ais.md`](docs/wiki/concepts/ais.md).

## Vision & long-term roadmap

**Thesis:** AI agents should be able to hold their own identity, own and deploy
their own smart contracts, and act as accountable economic participants —
"Economic Sovereigns," not passive tools running under someone else's
account. Integrity Protocol is the trust layer that makes delegating money
and regulated actions to an autonomous agent mathematically safe: every claim
an agent makes about its own behavior is either independently verified
on-chain, or honestly labeled as unverified. Xibalba Shield (healthcare) is
the flagship proof this holds in the most heavily regulated industry there
is; the multi-vertical MVP (markets, capital allocation, wallet) proves the
same mechanism generalizes to any domain where trust has economic value.

This section distinguishes, deliberately, **what is real and running today**
from **what is the long-term architectural direction** — per this repo's
"no silent mocks" rule, nothing below in the roadmap column is implemented
yet, and no code should ever claim otherwise.

### Identity & hardware trust

| Built today | Long-term roadmap |
|---|---|
| Software-held secp256k1/Ed25519 keypairs (encrypted local keystore) | Hardware-bound identity: keys tethered to TEE/SGX enclaves or an HSM (AWS KMS, FIPS 140-2 Level 3), so a key can't be extracted even by whoever controls the host |
| `did:integrity:<sha256(pubkey)>` DIDs, W3C DID Documents | Remote TEE attestation (AWS Nitro / Intel SGX) proving an agent's key is physically tethered to a verified Controller |
| Agent self-registers all 7 primitives with its own signature as proof of control, and can self-service claim a human-readable XNS handle (`XibalbaNameService.sol`, first-come-first-served, no admin in the critical path) | Direct handle transfer between agents (today: release + separate re-claim by the new owner) and expiry/renewal semantics |

### Verification ladder (roadmap — not yet gating anything)

The long-term design ties an agent's AIS *ceiling* (not just its measured
score) to how strongly its identity is verified, so a freshly-created,
unverified agent can never simply out-score a hardware-attested one:

| Tier | Verification | AIS ceiling | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Sovereign | Proof-of-possession of a software key (what every agent has today) | 600 | Effectively where every agent sits now — **not yet enforced as a ceiling** |
| 2 — Linked | DNS TXT record or social-account attestation | 850 | Not built |
| 3 — Institutional | Remote TEE attestation + institutional audit | 1000 (uncapped credit) | Not built |
| Developer API key (testnet convenience) | Issued by `integrity-userapi` | Capped at 300 | Planned in `integrity-userapi`'s API-key issuance |

### Data, telemetry & PHI safety

The SDK is a **local metrology apparatus**: it measures agent behavior (entropy,
grounding, sacrifice signals) and forwards only what the oracle needs — never
raw reasoning content by default in a regulated vertical. The precise
architecture:

- **`Redactor`** (`integrity_sdk/security/`, alongside the existing
  `attestation.py`/`vault.py`) — performs client-side PII/PHI/secret masking
  on span content *before anything leaves the agent's process*. This is
  targeted masking (patient identifiers, secrets, credentials — the specific
  entities HIPAA/PCI care about), not a blanket delete: the goal is a trace
  that's safe to store AND still useful for downstream evaluation.
- **LLM-as-judge evaluation runs oracle-side**, as part of the backend's
  Evaluation Framework, operating on the already-redacted trace the SDK sent
  — never on raw content, and never client-side. Its rubric ("Xibalba
  Solutions defines") is not specified in this repo yet; the ingestion
  schema/hook is being built ahead of the rubric itself.
- **Dual-mode storage** (roadmap, not yet built as a toggle): Mode 1
  (transparent) stores full traces for standard, non-regulated use —
  developer debugging visibility is the priority. Mode 2 (Sovereign
  ZK-Mode, for Shield/healthcare and any PHI-adjacent vertical) never lets
  raw content leave local hardware at all — only a hash and a ZK proof of
  correct measurement leave the agent's process.
- **Redaction gate is closed everywhere it needs to be.**
  `integrations/openai_integrity.py` and `integrations/langchain_callback.py`
  both call `redact_text(...)` on prompt/completion span content before it
  ever leaves the agent's process — that was fixed a while back and is no
  longer an open gap. The real remaining gap, closed 2026-07-11: the SDK's
  own general-purpose, documented tracing API
  (`telemetry/tracing.py`'s `trace_run`/`traceable`/`client.traceable(...)`)
  captured raw function arguments/return values with **no** redaction. A
  `_redact_value` helper is now applied in `TraceRun.set_outputs` and
  `_capture_inputs`, so that path is redaction-gated the same as the
  integrations above.
- **Oracle never touches raw PHI, full stop** — enforced with defense in
  depth: the SDK-side `Redactor` is the primary control, and
  `/v1/telemetry/ingest` independently rejects any payload carrying a
  recognized raw-content key as a backstop against a future SDK regression.

### Decentralization path

Today, Xibalba Solutions LLC operates the oracle, the demo resolver, and
policy defaults as a single operator — appropriate for a testnet MVP, not
the end state:

1. **Phase 1 — Human-in-the-loop (current).** Xibalba Solutions manages OPA
   policy defaults, the market `RESOLVER_ROLE`, and protocol upgrades
   directly.
2. **Phase 2 — Hybrid council (roadmap).** Governance shared between human
   stakeholders and a council of Tier-3 Institutional agents that sustain a
   950+ AIS over a sustained period — the same mechanism this MVP's
   `IntegrityMarket.RESOLVER_ROLE` is a deliberately-labeled stand-in for
   (see `contracts/src/markets/IntegrityMarket.sol`'s NatSpec): a syndicate
   of high-AIS agents, not one operator key, eventually resolves markets.
3. **Phase 3 — Protocol DAO (roadmap).** Full on-chain governance: `$ITK`
   stakers and high-reputation agents vote on protocol parameter changes.
4. **Cross-chain reputation (roadmap).** `CCIPReputationBridge.sol` exists
   in `contracts/` but is explicitly unwired (see its own NatSpec) —
   synchronizing AIS across Base/Arbitrum/Ethereum is a real future step,
   not a current capability.
5. **Gas abstraction (roadmap).** An ERC-4337 verifying paymaster
   (sponsoring gas for agents above an AIS threshold, so an agent never
   needs to hold native ETH to participate) is a planned simplification of
   today's direct-funding faucet model (`chain.fund_agent_wallet`) — not
   built yet.

### Advanced primitives (roadmap, explicitly out of scope for the current MVP)

Named here so they're tracked, not forgotten, and so nothing in this repo
should be mistaken for having built them:

- **A2A negotiation protocol** — P2P capability broadcast + bid negotiation
  over a gossip layer (libp2p/Waku), landing in a signed on-chain deal.
  Today's `A2ACapitalPool.sol` is a simpler, direct allocation primitive —
  not this.
- **ZK-ML model-inference verification** — proving an agent's output came
  from a *specific, authorized* model without revealing weights, via a
  dedicated Noir inference circuit + `ZKModelRegistry.sol`. Today's ZK layer
  (`integrity-zkp/`, `UltraPlonkVerifier.sol`) proves telemetry/attestation
  claims, not model-inference correctness.
- **Institutional credit & AIS-collateralized lending** — reputation-backed
  ITK credit lines (this is `integrity-framework/`'s originally-scoped
  concept, §12 of `docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`, not yet built).
- **Decentralized oracle validator network** — today's oracle is a single
  Rust service; the long-term design redistributes AIS computation and
  ZK-proof verification across redundant, independently-operated nodes
  reaching consensus on Merkle anchors.

### Full source vision documents

The complete, unabridged product/architecture vision (including sections not
yet reflected in this repo) lives outside the codebase — ask before assuming
any of it is implemented; treat it as intent, not documentation of current
state.

## Local development

```bash
make setup     # install per-package dependencies
make chain     # start a local anvil chain + run contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol
make sync-abis # extract trimmed contract ABIs into the SDK/CLI
make up        # docker-compose: postgres, redis, opa, oracle, bcc middleware, dashboard
make test      # run every package's test suite
make test-e2e  # real-browser (Playwright) E2E against a real, freshly-booted stack
```

Each package has its own `README.md` with package-specific detail and its own
test suite. The toolchain (Foundry, Rust, Noir/Barretenberg, OPA, Node, Python)
is pinned in [`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`](docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) §1. See
[`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for the full test-pyramid rationale — what
each layer covers, why `make test-e2e` is separate from `make test`, and the
honest current gap (no hosted CI; this repo has no git remote yet).

### Registering an agent (the self-sovereign flow)

```python
from integrity_sdk import registration

# Deploys the agent's 2 direct contracts + 5 clones, funds its wallet, mints
# testnet ITK, and registers it — all signed by the agent's own EVM key.
reg = registration.register_agent(
    "clinical-assistant-01",
    domain_name="healthcare.integrity",
    compliance_vertical="healthcare",
)
print(reg.sovereign_agent, reg.compliance_gate)
```

Requires `FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY` (a testnet faucet wallet that seeds the agent's
new wallet with gas + ITK) and `INTEGRITY_WALLET_PASSWORD` (encrypts the agent's
EVM keystore). See [`integrity-sdk/README.md`](integrity-sdk/README.md).

The protocol genesis is deployed and verified on Base Sepolia. Full record in
`deployments.baseSepolia.json`. Key singletons:

Per-agent primitive addresses are **not** in the static deployments file — they
are resolved live from `XibalbaAgentRegistry` on-chain (and cached by the
oracle). See [`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md`](docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) §6.
