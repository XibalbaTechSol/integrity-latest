# AIS API — Changelog

All notable wire-visible changes to this surface are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) — one entry per change an
integrator would actually observe, not one per commit.

## v1.0.0 — initial published surface

- First versioned, generated spec for the AIS API, covering all 10 `/v1/*` endpoints
  served by `integrity-oracle`'s backend.
- Fixed a real gap as part of this freeze: `GET /v1/agent/{id}` now returns
  `did_document` (previously accepted on `POST /v1/agent/register` and silently
  dropped — never persisted, never returned).
- `verification_tier` ships marked **RESERVED (partially enforced)**. Also fixed a
  real security-relevant gap in the same pass: this field was previously
  self-asserted by the *client* at registration with no server-side verification —
  any client could claim `verification_tier: 3`. `register_agent` now always
  computes and stores a server-verified value (currently always `1`, the only tier
  with a built verification path); the client-supplied value is accepted on the
  wire for shape compatibility but ignored.
- `A2ACapitalPool` has no read endpoint yet — deferred to a future minor version as
  net-new additive surface, not a v1 blocker.
