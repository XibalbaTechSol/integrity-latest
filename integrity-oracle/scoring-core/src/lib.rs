//! Agent Integrity Score (AIS) formula.
//!
//! This crate is the ONLY place the AIS formula is computed anywhere in the
//! Integrity Protocol monorepo — see `docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` §4.3. Every
//! other package (sdk, cli, dashboard, bcc_middleware) calls the oracle's
//! `GET /v1/agent/{id}/ais` HTTP endpoint rather than re-deriving this math;
//! that indirection is the entire point of having an "oracle" instead of just
//! letting every consumer compute its own opinion of an agent's trustworthiness.
//!
//! Formula (verbatim from the interface contract):
//!
//!   AIS = (S_entropy*wE + S_grounding*wG + S_sacrifice*wS + S_compliance*wC) * ZK_boost
//!
//! with default weights wE=0.30, wG=0.30, wS=0.20, wC=0.20 (sum to 1.0) and
//! ZK_boost = 1.15 when a real Barretenberg proof was verified for the agent
//! during the reporting period, else 1.0.
//!
//! The four `S_*` component scores are each normalized to the same
//! [0, MAX_COMPONENT_SCORE] range so that the weights above are directly
//! comparable contributions. The interface contract pins the top-level
//! formula and weights but does not pin how each S_* is derived from raw
//! telemetry — that derivation is this oracle's judgment call, documented
//! per-function below. If that derivation ever changes, only this file needs
//! to change; no other package embeds this math.
