//! Crate root for the `backend` (a.k.a. `oracle-backend`) binary — the integrity-oracle's
//! HTTP/indexing layer (`docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` §6.6's "not yet built" note, now
//! built). This file's only job is module wiring + the `build_router`/`AppState`
//! plumbing shared between `main.rs` (real server) and `tests/` (in-process integration
//! tests against a real Postgres + real anvil) — no business logic lives here.
