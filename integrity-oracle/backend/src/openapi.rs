//! Generates `spec/ais-api/v1/openapi.yaml` from the real handlers/DTOs in `handlers.rs`,
//! rather than hand-authoring the spec separately (which is exactly how the `agent_id`/
//! `did` field-name drift documented in `docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` §6.3 happened once
//! already for internal package coordination — this generation step is the backstop
//! against that recurring on the *external* wire surface). Run via `cargo run --bin
//! gen-openapi` (see `src/bin/gen_openapi.rs`); wire that into CI so the committed
//! `spec/ais-api/v1/openapi.yaml` can be diffed against a fresh generation to catch
//! any handler/schema change that wasn't accompanied by a spec regeneration.
//!
//! Split into two `#[derive(OpenApi)]` structs, merged at runtime via
//! `combined_openapi()`, because of a confirmed utoipa 5.5.0 limitation: a single
//! `paths(...)` list silently drops its last entry once it holds more than 15 items
//! (verified directly — removing any one path from a 16-item list makes the 16th
//! appear again; the macro expansion itself is correct, this is a runtime
//! aggregation issue on utoipa's side, not a bug in how these are declared). No such
//! limit was found on `components(schemas(...))` at 42 entries. If upgrading utoipa
//! ever fixes this upstream, both structs can be folded back into one — nothing here
//! depends on them staying separate beyond working around the limit.
