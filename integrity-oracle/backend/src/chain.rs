//! Read-only on-chain client, via `alloy`, for the self-sovereign per-agent primitive
//! model described in `docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` §6.
//!
//! This is the piece that makes agent registration honest end-to-end: a client POSTing
//! to `/v1/agent/register` could claim any 7 addresses it likes, but `resolve_primitives`
//! independently asks `XibalbaAgentRegistry` (the on-chain source of truth, written
//! atomically and exclusively by `AgentPrimitivesFactory`, §6.3) what it actually
//! recorded for that DID, and the handler rejects any mismatch. Everything in this module
//! is a `view`/`pure` call — no wallet, no signing, no transaction submission — per the
//! interface contract's current phase ("the oracle only ever READS on-chain state").
//!
//! Interface fragments below are hand-transcribed from the real, compiled ABIs at
//! `contracts/out/{XibalbaAgentRegistry,ReputationRegistry,ComplianceGate}.sol/*.json`
//! (cross-checked field-for-field against `contracts/src/framework/XibalbaAgentRegistry.sol`,
//! `contracts/src/oracle/ReputationRegistry.sol`, `contracts/src/shield/ComplianceGate.sol`)
//! rather than generated from the JSON artifact at build time: `sol!`'s `#[sol(rpc)]` over
//! a hand-written interface produces the exact same ABI-encoding/decoding code as loading
//! the JSON would, without making this crate's build depend on `contracts/` having been
//! built first (a real constraint in this monorepo, where `contracts/out/` is `forge
//! build` output, not something `cargo build` can assume exists in every checkout/CI
//! environment). If the on-chain interfaces above ever change, this file and the
//! `contracts/` source must be updated together — there's no build-time check tying them
//! together, which is a documented gap (see `resolve_primitives`'s doc comment).
