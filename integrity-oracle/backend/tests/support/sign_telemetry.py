"""
Test support: builds and EIP-191-signs a real `POST /v1/telemetry/ingest` payload for
a throwaway secp256k1 key, using integrity-sdk's own `bcc.canonical_json_bytes` (the
exact canonicalization `crypto::verify_agent_signature` on the Rust side must agree
with) so the signature this produces is byte-for-byte what a real agent would send —
not a hand-rolled approximation of the wire format.

Deliberately does NOT go through integrity-sdk's `IntegrityClient.flush_telemetry`:
that method's own docstring documents an unresolved telemetry-envelope-signing gap
unrelated to this test's purpose (verifying the oracle's SSE push matches its own AIS
read), so this script signs the envelope directly instead of depending on that gap's
resolution.

Args (all via argv): private_key_hex, agent_id, nonce (int), entropy, grounding,
sacrifice, compliance (floats), otel_spans_json (optional, default "[]")

`derived_signals` here is the CLAIMED value — since the oracle now independently
recomputes entropy/grounding/sacrifice from `otel_spans` content rather than trusting
this claim (see `backend/src/derive.rs`), a caller can pass a claim that deliberately
disagrees with what `otel_spans` actually contains, to prove the oracle's recomputation
wins (see `oracle_e2e_recomputed_grounding_overrides_inflated_client_claim` in
`tests/e2e.rs`).

Prints the full signed JSON payload (ready to POST as-is) to stdout.
