"""
Real OPA REST client -- the single most security-critical module in this
service.

docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §7 is unambiguous: "if OPA is unreachable, the
request must fail closed (deny), not silently approve." The old prototype
violated this by falling back to a hardcoded keyword scan when OPA was down
(masking an infra outage as "policy says yes" is a fail-OPEN bug -- an OPA
outage would have silently disabled all HIPAA guardrails). This module has
exactly one way to say "allowed": a well-formed HTTP 200 from a real OPA
server with `result.allow == true`. Every other outcome -- connection
refused, timeout, non-200, malformed JSON, missing `result` key -- raises
`OPAUnavailableError`, and the caller (main.py) treats that identically to
an explicit policy denial.
