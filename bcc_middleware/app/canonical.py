"""
Canonicalization + Ed25519 signature verification for BCC Commitments.

*** RECONCILED against integrity-sdk / integrity-cli (see
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.2 and the package README's "Integration
reconciliation" #1-2) ***. Two things §4.2 originally left open, now pinned:

  (a) Canonical JSON = `json.dumps(fields, sort_keys=True,
      separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=True)` encoded as UTF-8.
      `ensure_ascii=True` specifically (not the RFC 8785/JCS default) --
      this is the byte-for-byte rule integrity-sdk's canonical_json_bytes
      also implements; a mismatch here would silently break signatures on
      any non-ASCII content.
  (b) The DID fingerprint is `sha256(pubkey)`, NOT the raw public key --
      a real one-way fingerprint, not a self-encoding one. Since a sha256
      digest can't be inverted back to the key it hashed, a verifier
      holding only `agent_id` cannot recover the pubkey needed to check
      `signature`. The commitment therefore carries the agent's own public
      key (`agent_public_key`, multibase, same form as the DID document's
      `publicKeyMultibase`), and this module BINDS it before trusting it:
      `sha256(decoded_pubkey) == agent_id` fingerprint, or reject. That
      binding is what makes trusting a carried key safe -- see
      `public_key_from_commitment` below.
