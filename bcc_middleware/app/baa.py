Real on-chain Business Associate Agreement (BAA) status check.

Healthcare-vertical intents (see `requires_baa` in policies/bcc.rego) must
not be authorized unless the agent currently has an *active* BAA recorded
on-chain -- this is a legal/compliance gate, not just a technical one, so it
has to be a real `eth_call` against a real contract, never a hardcoded
allowlist (that was the old prototype's "STAGING MODE" bug this rewrite is
explicitly told not to repeat).

On-chain interface actually implemented by `contracts/src/shield/
SmartBAAFactory.sol` (confirmed against the real, already-built/tested
Solidity, not assumed):

    function isBAAActive(address coveredEntity, address businessAssociate) external view returns (bool);

*** CORRECTED PROTOCOL BUG ***
This module used to call a single-argument `isBAAActive(address agent)` --
a signature invented before `contracts/` existed to call against, and never
caught because there was no real contract to catch it. The real factory
contract is keyed on the *pair* `(coveredEntity, businessAssociate)`: one
`SmartBAA` escrow exists per hospital<->agent relationship (see
`SmartBAAFactory.baaOf`), so "is this agent's BAA active" is meaningless
without also saying *which* covered entity it's active with. Calling the
real two-arg function with a one-arg ABI encoding would either revert (best
case -- caught below and correctly treated as CANNOT_VERIFY) or, far worse,
silently ABI-decode into a plausible-but-wrong bool if a future contract
happened to have a matching 4-byte selector by coincidence. Always keep this
ABI byte-for-byte in sync with the deployed contract's real signature rather
than a remembered/assumed one.

`businessAssociate` is derived from the commitment's `agent_id` DID via
`chain.agent_id_to_address` (see that module for the documented, flagged
DID->address convention). `coveredEntity` comes directly from the
commitment's `covered_entity_address` field (see schemas.py) -- it is NOT
derived via `agent_id_to_address`, since a covered entity has no DID at all
in this protocol (it's registered by raw EVM address in
`contracts/src/shield/CoveredEntityRegistry.sol`).

Fail-closed policy: if we cannot positively confirm `isBAAActive == true`
(no contract address configured yet, no covered_entity_address on the
commitment, RPC unreachable, call reverts, wrong ABI on the deployed
contract, etc.) the result is `BAAStatus.CANNOT_VERIFY`, and main.py treats
that identically to `INACTIVE` -- i.e. it denies. A missing/broken BAA check
must never be interpreted as "assume compliant".
