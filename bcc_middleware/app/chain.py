Shared web3 plumbing used by both the on-chain BAA check (baa.py) and Merkle
anchoring (anchor.py).

Both of those are genuine on-chain interactions against whatever EVM node
`RPC_URL` points at -- a local anvil instance in dev/test, per
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §1/§2. Nothing in this module is a mock: if
`RPC_URL` is unreachable, `get_w3().is_connected()` returns False and callers
decide how to fail (closed for BAA, best-effort-logged for anchoring -- see
those modules' docstrings for why they differ).

    Deliberately NOT `resolve_agent_primitives` (also a `GET /v1/agent/{id}` call):
    that function's `@lru_cache` treats its result as immutable forever, which is
    correct for primitive addresses (they can't change post-registration) but would
    be wrong here — `verification_tier` is agent-mutable state (today it's always 1
    since no Tier 2/3 verification path exists yet, but this function must not bake
    in "tier never changes" as an assumption once that path is built). No caching.

    Fails to tier 0 (the lowest/most-restrictive tier) rather than raising, on any
    lookup failure — deliberately different from `agent_id_to_address`'s hard-fail
    behavior. Tier-gated `intent_type`s correctly deny on an unresolvable tier (fail
    closed for what actually needs it), but this must not take down every other,
    non-tier-gated commitment on a transient oracle hiccup — see `main.py`, which

    The businessAssociate is the agent's **SovereignAgent contract address** —
    NOT its EOA/wallet, and not a derivation from the DID pubkey. That's
    deliberate and load-bearing: `SmartBAAFactory.createBAA` records the

    downstream Shield contracts (`EHRGate.checkAccess`, `ComplianceGate`) all
    treat the SovereignAgent *contract* as the acting agent (it's their
