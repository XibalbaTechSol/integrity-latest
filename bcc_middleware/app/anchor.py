"""
Submits a computed Merkle root to the on-chain `StateAnchor` contract.

Expected on-chain interface (documented here for `contracts/` to match):

    function anchorRoot(bytes32 root) external;

*** Anchoring is best-effort, NOT a security gate ***
Unlike OPA policy evaluation and the on-chain BAA check -- both of which
must fail CLOSED because they gate whether an action is authorized --
anchoring happens *after* a commitment has already been authorized. Its
purpose is building a tamper-evident audit trail, not deciding whether to
allow the action. So:
  - If `StateAnchor` isn't deployed yet (no address in
    deployments.local.json -- expected in dev before `contracts/` deploys),
    or the RPC/signer isn't configured, or the transaction fails, we log a
    warning and keep the batch's leaves so a later flush can retry. We do
    NOT deny or reverse the already-returned authorization -- blocking a
    real-time policy decision on L1 confirmation latency would defeat the
    point of a low-latency pre-execution gate.
  - This is a deliberate, documented asymmetry from the BAA check, not an
    oversight -- see README "Fail-closed vs. best-effort" section.

    Anchor a flushed batch to each agent's OWN StateAnchor, respecting the
    per-agent-primitive model (there is no longer one global StateAnchor).

    A `MerkleBatcher` accumulates approved commitments across *all* agents, so a
    flushed batch is a mix. This function splits that mix by `agent_id`, builds a
    per-agent sub-tree over just that agent's leaves, resolves that agent's own
    `StateAnchor` clone address (via the oracle — see
    chain.resolve_agent_primitives), and anchors the sub-root there. Each agent's
    StateAnchor therefore only ever accumulates that agent's own commitments — a
    genuinely per-agent, tamper-evident audit trail, which is more correct than a
    single cross-agent root anchored to some arbitrary agent's contract.

    Best-effort, exactly like the single-anchor path: an agent whose StateAnchor
    can't be resolved (unknown to the oracle, oracle down) or whose anchor tx
    fails is logged and skipped, never raised — anchoring happens *after*
    authorization and is an audit trail, not a gate. Returns a per-agent map of
    AnchorResult so the caller can log the outcome per agent.

    N transactions per flush (one per distinct agent) is the accepted cost of
    per-agent anchoring at this scale — the same tradeoff integrity-oracle makes
    for its own epoch anchoring.
