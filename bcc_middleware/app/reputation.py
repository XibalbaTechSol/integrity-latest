"""
Pushes AIS scores to each agent's ReputationRegistry clone and raises
Slasher disputes on detected misbehavior -- closes the loop nothing else
in this monorepo does: integrity-oracle computes AIS and flags misbehavior
but, deliberately (see its own chain.rs docstring: "this service never
signs or submits transactions"), never pushes anything on-chain. Nothing
else did either, until this module. See app/scoring_loop.py for the
periodic orchestration that calls these primitives, and
PRODUCTION_GAPS.md for this gap's history.

bcc_middleware is the chosen home for this signer, not a new dedicated
service: on today's single-operator testnet deployment
(deployments.baseSepolia.json's protocolAddresses), oracleSigner,
disputer, and this service's existing ANCHOR_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY /
ANCHOR_ROLE key are the same address, so reusing it avoids standing up a
new service and a new key custody boundary for a role the operator
already holds.

*** Score pushes are best-effort, like anchoring -- NOT a security gate ***
A failed or delayed push leaves an agent's on-chain score stale, not
wrong-but-trusted: nothing downstream treats "no update yet" as "verified
good". Same posture as app/anchor.py; see that module's docstring.

*** Disputes are automated but not dangerous -- raising one only LOCKS
stake, it never moves funds ***. See contracts/src/oracle/Slasher.sol's
own NatSpec: `resolveDispute` needs a separate arbiter role (never the
same key as DISPUTER_ROLE) and a full challenge window before anything is
actually burned. A false-positive automated dispute is recoverable by
that arbiter, not catastrophic -- which is what makes it safe for
app/scoring_loop.py's periodic polling to raise them without a human in
the loop at raise-time.
