"""
Merkle batch construction, per docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.4.

This MUST match `integrity-oracle` and `contracts` bit-for-bit, since the
root computed here gets verified on-chain against whatever `contracts`'
`StateAnchor.sol` + OpenZeppelin `MerkleProof.verify` expect. The two rules
from §4.4 this module implements exactly:

  1. Hash function: keccak256 (not sha256 -- it's cheap/native in the EVM,
     and what `MerkleProof.verify` uses).
  2. Parent hashing sorts each child pair ascending before concatenating:
     `keccak256(a < b ? a,b : b,a)`. This is the OpenZeppelin convention:
     it makes leaf position irrelevant to the proof, avoids a
     second-preimage ordering ambiguity, and lets `contracts` verify with
     the stock OZ `MerkleProof` library instead of a custom verifier.

*** INTEGRATION FLAG: leaf encoding ***
§4.4 pins down the hash function and pairing rule but not the exact leaf
*payload* -- what fields get packed into each leaf before hashing is a
cross-package agreement between bcc_middleware (which produces leaves),
integrity-oracle (which likely also builds/verifies batches for scoring),
and contracts (whose `StateAnchor.sol` treats the root as opaque, but
whoever submits a MerkleProof against a leaf needs to reconstruct it
identically). This module's leaf encoding is documented immediately below
`leaf_hash()` -- confirm it during integration before anyone relies on
proofs generated against these leaves.

*** ODD-NODE-COUNT CONVENTION ***
When a level has an odd number of nodes, this implementation duplicates the
last, unpaired node (i.e. it hashes it with itself) rather than promoting it
unchanged. This is the OpenZeppelin-standard convention: it matches
`integrity-oracle`'s `merkle.rs` and `contracts`' `StateAnchor.sol`
bit-for-bit, and it keeps every level a keccak256 output, so a proof step is
always a `_hash_pair` call with no special-casing for odd levels.
