"""
Real integration test for the on-chain BAA gate against the ACTUAL
`contracts/` shield stack -- `CoveredEntityRegistry` + `SmartBAAFactory` +
`SmartBAA` + `IntegrityToken` -- not the lightweight `MockBAARegistry`
fixture that tests/test_chain_baa_anchor.py uses for its broader
eth_call-plumbing coverage.

Why this file exists in addition to that one: the whole point of the bug
this rewrite fixed (`app/baa.py` calling a one-argument `isBAAActive(agent)`
that no real contract ever implemented) is that `MockBAARegistry` was
written to match the WRONG assumed signature and so could never have caught
it -- there was no real contract to check against. This file closes that
gap for good: it compiles/deploys the real Solidity from the sibling
`contracts/` package (via `forge build`'s output in `contracts/out/`,
per docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's monorepo layout) onto a real local anvil
chain, drives the real registration/creation/signing lifecycle, and proves
`check_baa_status` gets a real True/False back from the real two-argument
`isBAAActive(coveredEntity, businessAssociate)`.

*** Why the agent side of these transactions uses anvil impersonation ***
`app/chain.py::agent_id_to_address` now resolves an agent's real
`SovereignAgent` contract address from integrity-oracle's
`GET /v1/agent/{id}` (see that module and tests/helpers.py's
`mock_oracle_agent_resolution` -- a real oracle isn't part of this file's
fixture set, so its one HTTP call is stubbed, returning a fresh
`Account.create()` address that stands in for "the agent's real on-chain
SovereignAgent address" for these tests' purposes). Either way -- whether a
real oracle resolved it or a freshly generated EVM account stands in for one
-- this test doesn't hold that address's private key, so nothing can locally
sign a transaction FROM it. To drive a real on-chain `SmartBAA.sign()` call as
that exact address (the same address `check_baa_status` independently
re-resolves and queries), this test uses anvil's
`anvil_impersonateAccount`/`anvil_setBalance` cheat RPC methods -- the
JSON-RPC equivalent of Foundry's `vm.prank`, which
`contracts/test/shield/SmartBAA.t.sol` already uses for the identical
purpose. This is a standard local-test-chain technique for driving a
contract call as an address you don't hold a key for; it is not a mock of
anything this test is actually verifying (the deployed contracts, the
`isBAAActive` ABI/call, and `check_baa_status`'s interpretation of the
result are all real).
