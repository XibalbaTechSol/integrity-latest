Extracts {abi, bytecode} for the contracts integrity-sdk's chain.py needs to
deploy directly or call, out of Foundry's `contracts/out/*.sol/*.json` build
artifacts, and writes trimmed JSON files into
integrity-sdk/integrity_sdk/abis/.

Run via `make sync-abis` from the repo root (that target runs `forge build`
first so this always reads fresh artifacts). This is a one-way, run-when-
contracts-change sync step, not a runtime dependency — integrity-sdk never
reads contracts/out/ directly, only these trimmed copies, so the SDK package
stays installable/usable without a Foundry toolchain present.

Also writes the identical trimmed JSON into integrity-cli/integrity_cli/abis/
-- integrity-cli's chain.py needs the exact same {abi, bytecode} artifacts
to deploy/call the same contracts, but per identity.py's "no sibling
dependency on integrity-sdk" philosophy the CLI carries its own copy rather
than importing integrity_sdk.abis. Single source of truth stays
contracts/out/; this script is what keeps both packages' copies in sync
rather than hand-copying whenever contracts change.

Also writes {abi}-only (no bytecode -- the frontend only ever calls existing
deployed contracts, never deploys) JSON into integrity-mvp/src/abis/ for the
subset of contracts the wallet-interactive dashboard calls directly via
wagmi/viem, plus copies the two deployments.*.json address files into
integrity-mvp/src/deployments/ so the frontend can pick addresses by
VITE_CHAIN_ID without a runtime dependency on the repo root's file layout.
