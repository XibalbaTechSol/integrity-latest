"""
Agent-side on-chain client: funding, direct contract deployment, and
primitive registration against the Integrity Protocol contracts.

CLI-local reimplementation of integrity_sdk.chain -- same real web3.py calls
against whatever EVM node RPC_URL points at (no mocked transport), same
ABI/bytecode artifacts, same transaction sequence. Duplicated rather than
imported per identity.py's "no sibling dependency on integrity-sdk while
both packages are still in flux" philosophy, scoped down to exactly what
`integrity agent register` needs: fund/deploy/register. Unlike the SDK's
chain.py, this module has no telemetry-adjacent surface to trim -- the SDK
version was already just fund/deploy/register, so this is a straight port,
not a subset.

Every function below (except `fund_agent_wallet`/`mint_testnet_itk`, which
are explicitly the funder wallet's actions) signs as the *agent's own*
wallet (see wallet.py) -- that distinction is the entire point of the
self-sovereign registration model documented in
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's "Agent Primitives" section: an agent's
identity/anchor contracts are deployed by a transaction the agent itself
signed, not one the protocol signed on its behalf.
