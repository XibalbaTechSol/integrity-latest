"""
BCC Commitment construction and signing.

The BCC Commitment is the intent-lock object exchanged between an agent
(here, the CLI acting on a developer's behalf) and bcc_middleware's
`POST /v1/bcc/intercept` pre-execution policy gate. Field names and shape
are pinned in docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md section 4.2 -- do not rename or
restructure them here, since bcc_middleware and integrity-sdk are being
built against this exact contract in parallel.

Canonicalization note: the contract requires the signature to cover "the
above fields, canonical JSON" but does not pin the exact byte
serialization. We use `json.dumps(fields, sort_keys=True,
separators=(",", ":"))` (sorted keys, no whitespace) -- the de facto
standard for "canonical JSON" in protocols like this. This is a real
integration risk called out in README.md: if bcc_middleware/integrity-sdk
canonicalize differently, signatures built here won't verify there even
though the commitment shape is otherwise correct.
