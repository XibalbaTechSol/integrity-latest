Shared test fixtures.

Every test gets its own tmp_path standing in for the user's home directory
(~/.integrity-cli) -- this is what lets the suite run safely in CI/dev
without ever touching a real developer's actual config or identity keys,
and lets tests run in parallel without clobbering each other's state.
