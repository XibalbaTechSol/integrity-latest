/// gets its identity contracts deployed on its behalf — it deploys its own
/// `SovereignAgent` and `StateAnchor` directly, from its own EVM wallet, so those two
/// deployment transactions are themselves the cryptographic proof of self-sovereign
/// control (see docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's "Agent Primitives" section). This
/// contract's job starts *after* that: given the two agent-deployed addresses, it clones
/// the other 5 primitives (cheap EIP-1167 proxies of shared implementation contracts),
/// initializes each with the agent's SovereignAgent contract as admin — never the raw
/// EOA, per the protocol's call-routing convention — and atomically registers the full
/// 7-address PrimitiveSet into XibalbaAgentRegistry and DomainRegistry so no consumer can
/// ever observe an agent that only half-exists.
/// @dev Bootstrap exception to "SovereignAgent routes everything": this call is EOA-signed
/// directly (SovereignAgent cannot route a call to register itself — that would be
/// circular), verified instead by checking the caller actually holds DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
/// on the SovereignAgent it claims to own. Holds REGISTRAR_ROLE on both registries
/// (granted to this contract's address at deploy time, see script/Deploy.s.sol) — no
/// other contract should hold that role, same reasoning as the old AgentFactory.
