/// @title Slasher
/// @notice Holds agents' $ITK collateral and executes programmatic, dispute-gated
/// slashing when an agent is found to have violated protocol rules.
/// @dev Self-contained: unlike the old prototype's Slasher (which read "deals" from a
/// separate marketplace contract not in this rewrite's scope), staking and dispute
/// state both live here, so this contract's guarantees don't depend on an external
/// contract this package doesn't control.
///
/// Why a dispute window exists at all: DISPUTER_ROLE is meant to be held by the
/// integrity-oracle backend, which raises a dispute automatically off the back of an
/// automated signal (e.g. a BCC commitment that didn't match the agent's actual
/// on-chain action). Automated signals can be wrong — a bug in the oracle, a
/// mis-parsed payload, a compromised oracle signing key. If `raiseDispute` could
/// immediately move funds, a single bad oracle report (or a briefly compromised oracle
/// key) could destroy an agent's entire stake before any human ever looked at it.
/// Instead, raising a dispute only *locks* the disputed amount (the agent can't
/// withdraw it, so it can't be front-run away), and actual fund movement
/// (`resolveDispute`) requires both (a) the challenge window to have fully elapsed,
/// giving the agent/operator time to present counter-evidence off-chain, and (b) a
/// separate arbiter role (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, expected to be a multisig/governance
/// address, not the same key as DISPUTER_ROLE) to make the actual call.
/// @dev Per-agent EIP-1167 clone (see AgentPrimitivesFactory). `itk` stays a real
/// Solidity `immutable` rather than an `initialize()` parameter: it is baked into the
/// implementation contract's own runtime bytecode at that implementation's one-time
/// deployment, and since every clone delegatecalls into that same bytecode, every
/// agent's Slasher clone reads the identical, correct $ITK address for free — no need to
/// spend a storage write repeating a value that never varies per agent. `admin`
/// (arbiter) and `disputer` DO vary in spirit (they're protocol-governance/oracle
/// signers, not the agent) but are passed as `initialize()` params rather than
/// implementation-immutables so a future re-key of governance doesn't require
/// redeploying the implementation and every dependent clone.
