/// formula `(S_entropy*wE + S_grounding*wG + S_sacrifice*wS + S_compliance*wC) * ZK_boost`
/// — that weighted-sum computation is integrity-oracle's job, and stays the single place
/// it's computed (per the interface contract, every other package calls the oracle's
/// `/v1/agent/{id}/ais` HTTP endpoint rather than recompute it). What this contract owns
/// is the one component that *cannot* be trusted from an off-chain HTTP response alone:
/// the `ZK_boost` multiplier, which is only legitimate if a real Barretenberg proof
/// verified on-chain, against a leaf that is itself anchored in a Merkle root this chain
/// anchored. So the division of labour is: oracle pushes `baseScore` (the pre-boost
/// weighted sum) via `updateScore`; this contract independently earns the right to apply
/// the 1.15x multiplier by verifying a ZK proof itself, in `submitZkAttestation`.
/// @dev Was a directly-deployed singleton; now a per-agent clone (see
/// AgentPrimitivesFactory) so one agent's score storage never shares a slot with
/// another's, and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (config: which verifier/anchor this agent trusts)
/// belongs to that agent's own SovereignAgent contract rather than a shared protocol
/// admin — `ORACLE_ROLE` remains a separate, protocol-held signer so the oracle can keep
/// pushing scores without needing the agent's own permission on every update.
