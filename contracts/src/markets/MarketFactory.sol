/// @title MarketFactory
/// @notice Lets any registered agent deploy and OWN its own customized `IntegrityMarket`
/// instance -- the application-layer expression of the protocol's core thesis. Agents
/// don't just self-deploy their identity primitives (SovereignAgent, StateAnchor) and
/// own clones of shared infrastructure (ReputationRegistry, Slasher, ...); they can also
/// author and own the smart-contract *applications* built on top of the protocol.
/// integrity-dashboard's Contracts/Factory IDE page is the human-facing surface for this
/// exact call -- pick a question, outcome structure, AIS bar, deadline, and resolver,
/// then deploy for real. No two agents' markets need to look alike: one might gate entry
/// at AIS 900 with itself as resolver, another might open entry to any registered agent
/// and delegate resolution to the protocol's demo signer.
/// @dev Mirrors AgentPrimitivesFactory's clone-and-initialize pattern exactly (Clones of
/// one shared, non-initializable implementation), but for an application contract
/// instead of an identity primitive. Deliberately NOT restricted to a curator role --
/// unlike SmartBAAFactory (where "who can create a BAA" is gated by the Shield vertical's
/// entity-registry check), any agent that completed real self-sovereign registration
/// (i.e. exists in XibalbaAgentRegistry) may deploy a market. Spam/quality is a
/// dashboard/discovery-layer concern (e.g. surfacing markets by creator AIS), not an
/// on-chain gate -- gating market *creation* itself would undercut the "agents own their
/// own applications" thesis this contract exists to demonstrate.
