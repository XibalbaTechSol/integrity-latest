"""
Behavioral Commitment Chain (BCC) commitment construction — docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.2.

A BCC commitment is the intent-lock object an agent produces *before* taking
an action: "I, agent X, am about to do intent Y, whose payload hashes to Z,
and I've signed this whole statement with my DID key." `bcc_middleware`
(a sibling package, built independently and in parallel) receives this exact
JSON shape at `POST /v1/bcc/intercept` and must be able to reconstruct the
same hash and verify the same signature from the raw JSON alone — so the
canonicalization rules below are not a style preference, they're part of the
wire protocol.

Canonical JSON encoding (used for BOTH the intent-payload hash and the
commitment signature):
  - `json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=True)`
  - Keys sorted lexicographically (byte-wise ASCII order) — this is what
    `sort_keys=True` does in Python and what most other languages' "sort
    object keys" helpers do too, so it's a safe cross-language convention.
  - No inserted whitespace (`separators=(",", ":")`).
  - `ensure_ascii=True` (json's default): non-ASCII characters are escaped as
    `\\uXXXX` rather than emitted as raw UTF-8 bytes. This is REQUIRED for
    byte-for-byte reproducibility — a Rust or Go implementation using a
    different default here would produce a different byte string and a
    different hash/signature, even though the *logical* JSON is identical.
  - Integers only for `nonce` and `timestamp` — never floats. Python's `json`
    renders `1719000000000` and `1719000000000.0` differently, and other
    languages differ on trailing `.0`, so floats here would break
    cross-implementation hash agreement.

Hash function: intended_state_hash is fixed by the contract to be SHA-256
of the canonical intent payload (not a policy choice made here).

    Persists a monotonically increasing per-agent nonce to disk so it

    "monotonic per-agent" — a nonce that resets to 0 on every restart would
    let a compromised or buggy client replay an old commitment's nonce,
    which is exactly what monotonicity is meant to prevent.

    This is intentionally simple (a single JSON counter file behind a
    process-local lock) and is NOT safe for multiple processes sharing one
    agent identity concurrently — that would need a real lock file or a
    server-side nonce authority (bcc_middleware could serve this role).

    Field names are load-bearing (per the contract) — do not rename them.

    Two fields beyond the frozen §4.2 five are signed over here, and MUST
    match `bcc_middleware/app/canonical.py` byte-for-byte or every signature
    fails verification:

      - `covered_entity_address`: the hospital an `EMR_WRITE`/clinical intent
        is against (nullable for non-healthcare intents). Signed, not just
        carried, so an attacker can't swap the target hospital on an
        otherwise-valid commitment (see schemas.py's field docstring).

      - `agent_public_key`: the agent's Ed25519 public key in the same
        multibase form as the DID document's `publicKeyMultibase` (§4.1).
        This is REQUIRED because this SDK's DID fingerprint is
        `sha256(pubkey)`, NOT the raw pubkey — so a verifier holding only the
        `agent_id` DID string cannot recover the key to check the signature.
        Carrying it here makes the commitment self-verifying: the middleware
        confirms `sha256(decoded_pubkey) == did_fingerprint` (binding the key
        to the DID, so it can't be substituted) and then verifies the
        signature against it. No external DID-resolution round-trip needed.
