"""
IntegrityClient: the SDK's telemetry client — the piece that ties the OTel
run-tree tracing (telemetry/tracing.py), the edge batcher (batcher.py), the
AIS-signal derivation (telemetry/derive.py), and the oracle's
`POST /v1/telemetry/ingest` endpoint together.

Before this module existed, `telemetry/tracing.py` referenced
`client._record_trace_run(...)`, `integrations/openai_integrity.py` and
`integrations/langchain_callback.py` referenced `client.log_telemetry(...)`,
and `telemetry/metrics.py`'s docstring referenced `client.py`'s
`_process_and_send` — all dangling references to a client that was never
written in this rewrite. This closes them: those are the real methods below.

Telemetry here is best-effort observability, NOT part of the trust chain
(unlike the BCC/OPA/ZK/attestation paths, which fail closed) — a flush that
can't reach the oracle logs a warning and re-queues, it never crashes the
agent's actual work. That asymmetry is deliberate and matches
bcc_middleware's own fail-closed-vs-best-effort split.

        FIXED 2026-07-11 — this method was shipping a request the real oracle
        could never accept, on two independent counts, confirmed against
        `integrity-oracle/backend/src/handlers.rs`'s actual
        `TelemetryIngestRequest` struct and its own real-HTTP e2e test
        (`tests/e2e.rs`, which hand-builds a request in the *correct* shape —
        that's what exposed this):
          1. `otel_spans` is typed `Vec<serde_json::Value>` (a JSON array) on
             the oracle side. This method was sending a JSON *object*
             (`{"telemetry": [...], "trace_runs": [...]}`) — Axum's JSON
             extractor rejects that at deserialization, before the handler
             ever runs. Fixed: both lists are now flattened into one tagged
             array (`{"kind": "telemetry"|"trace_run", ...}` per element) —
             the oracle stores this column as opaque JSONB and never
             destructures individual elements, so any array shape works; the
             tag is for a human/future-code reader distinguishing the two
             origins, not a schema requirement.
          2. `signature` is a required `String` on the oracle side, not
             `Option<String>` — this method was sending `None`/`null`, a
             second, independent deserialization failure. Worse: even a
             syntactically-valid empty string would still fail, since
             `ingest_telemetry`'s handler calls `crypto::verify_agent_signature`
             and returns 401 on a bad signature — the "handler currently
             treats the signature as optional" claim this docstring used to
             make was simply wrong. Fixed: if `self._keypair` was provided at
             construction, this method now signs the canonical JSON of
             `{agent_id, nonce, otel_spans, derived_signals, zk_proof}` —
             same field set, same `bcc.canonical_json_bytes` convention the
             oracle's own `crypto::canonical_json_bytes` mirrors (sorted
             keys, no whitespace) — exactly as `ingest_telemetry`'s handler
             reconstructs and checks it. Without a keypair, this still sends
             an empty-string signature (so the request at least
             *deserializes*) and will get a real, honest 401 from the oracle,
             which the existing failure/re-queue path below already handles
             — construct this client with `keypair=` to actually succeed.

        Known remaining narrower gap, not fixed here: Rust's `serde_json`
        does not escape non-ASCII characters by default, while this SDK's
        canonicalization (matching `bcc.py`, shared for consistency) uses
        `ensure_ascii=True`. For telemetry content containing non-ASCII text,
        the two sides' canonical bytes — and therefore the signature — could
        disagree. Not exercised by any current test; flagged rather than
        silently assumed fine, same as `bcc.py`'s own canonicalization
        docstring already does for a related concern.

        Also now drains `telemetry/metrics.py`'s `MetricsRegistry` (see
        `record_metric`) into the same tagged `otel_spans` array — that
        module was fully built but never wired into any flush path at all
        until now (a separate dangling-reference gap from the two above).
