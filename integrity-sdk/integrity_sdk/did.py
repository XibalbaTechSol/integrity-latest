"""
Decentralized Identifier (DID) module for the Integrity Protocol.

Implements the `did:integrity:<hex-pubkey-fingerprint>` method described in
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.1. Identity here is *key-based*, not
hardware-based: the DID is derived from an Ed25519 public key, and anyone
holding the matching private key can produce signatures that verify against
the DID document's `verificationMethod`. There is no hardware fallback and
no non-Ed25519 signing path — see `_REMOVED: HMAC fallback` note below for
why that matters.

Security note on the old prototype: the previous SDK (integrity-sdk v2.2.0)
shipped a `_DeterministicKeypair` that signed with HMAC-SHA512 over a seed
derived from the machine's hardware fingerprint whenever the `cryptography`
package was missing. That is NOT a signature scheme — HMAC is symmetric, so
"verifying" it requires the same secret the signer used, which defeats the
entire point of a DID (public verifiability by third parties who never see
the private key). This rebuild requires `cryptography` unconditionally: if
it isn't installed, DID creation fails loudly instead of silently downgrading
to a scheme that only *looks* like a signature.
