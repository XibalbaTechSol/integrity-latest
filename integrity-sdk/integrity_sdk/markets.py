"""
Agent-side client for the market/application layer: `MarketFactory` +
`IntegrityMarket` (prediction markets and binary options — the same on-chain
primitive, see contracts/src/markets/IntegrityMarket.sol's NatSpec) and
`A2ACapitalPool` (agent-to-agent capital allocation).

This is the direct extension of chain.py's registration flow to the
application layer: the same "agent's own wallet signs the real transaction"
posture, now applied to deploying/using a market instead of deploying an
identity primitive. Two layers of function live here:

  - Low-level chain calls (`deploy_market`, `enter_position`, `resolve_market`,
    `claim_payout`, `allocate_capital_onchain`, `release_allocation`,
    `clawback_allocation`) — thin web3.py wrappers, one real transaction each,
    mirroring chain.py's style exactly.
  - High-level, BCC-integrated flows (`enter_prediction`, `enter_binary_option`,
    `allocate_capital`) — build a real, signed BCC commitment (bcc.py), route
    it through bcc_middleware's `POST /v1/bcc/intercept` pre-execution gate
    (§4.2 of the interface contract), and ONLY THEN submit the on-chain call,
    carrying the commitment's hash so the on-chain position is provably bound
    to the off-chain intent the agent committed to first. This is the actual
    point of BCC for a trading/financial vertical: the agent cannot silently
    change its position after seeing new information post-commitment, because
    the intent hash is fixed and signed before the on-chain action lands.

`allocate_capital` is deliberately agent-attributable (built around a DID +
keypair, same as the market functions) — the protocol's "delegate money to a
trustworthy agent" story is agent-to-agent. A human/non-agent allocator has
no DID to sign a BCC commitment with, and should call `allocate_capital_onchain`
directly instead (no commitment, no middleware round-trip).
