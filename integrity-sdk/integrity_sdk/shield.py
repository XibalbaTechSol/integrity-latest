"""
Agent-side client for the Shield (HIPAA/healthcare) vertical: `CoveredEntityRegistry`,
`SmartBAAFactory` + `SmartBAA`, `ComplianceGate`, and `EHRGate`.

Was PRODUCTION_GAPS.md's own documented gap until this module existed: the ABIs
existed (`scripts/sync_abis.py`'s CONTRACTS list already synced `ComplianceGate`,
`CoveredEntityRegistry`, `SmartBAAFactory`, `SmartBAA` — added for exactly this module,
per that script's own comment — plus `EHRGate`, added alongside this file) but zero
Python wrapper functions called any of them; `integrity-mvp/demo`'s Clinician-Delta
persona (docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §11) has nothing to build against without this.

Mirrors `markets.py`'s two-tier style exactly: thin, one-real-transaction-each wrappers
around `chain._contract`, reusing `markets._execute_via_agent` for every call an
application contract gates on `agentRegistry.isRegisteredAgent(msg.sender)` — i.e.
`msg.sender` must be the agent's SovereignAgent CONTRACT, never its raw controller
wallet (see that helper's own docstring for why).

Not every function here is agent-routed, though — three real, distinct signer roles
exist in this vertical, and mixing them up is a real on-chain revert, not just a style
choice:
  - `register_covered_entity`: signed by whoever holds REGISTRAR_ROLE (the protocol's
    funder/governance address on today's single-operator testnet) — a direct call, no
    agent involved yet.
  - `create_baa`: signed by the COVERED ENTITY's own EOA (`CoveredEntityRegistry.
    isActiveCoveredEntity(msg.sender)` gates it) — hospitals aren't registered agents
    with a SovereignAgent contract, so this is a plain wallet transaction too.
  - `sign_baa`, `set_self_declared_compliance`, `verify_and_log_access`: signed by the
    AGENT (the business associate / the entity accessing PHI) and MUST be execute-routed
    through its SovereignAgent contract, or the on-chain identity checks fail.
  - `grant_ehr_access`, `revoke_ehr_access`: signed by the PATIENT's own EOA
    (`EHRGate.grantAccess`/`revokeAccess` key off `msg.sender` as the patient directly)
    — patients aren't agents either.
