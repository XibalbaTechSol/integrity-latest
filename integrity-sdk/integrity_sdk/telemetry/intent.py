"""
Pre-execution intent capture: `invoke_intent`, the OTel counterpart to
`bcc.build_bcc_commitment` (docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.2).

Why this file exists — the gap it closes:

A BCC commitment (`bcc.py`) already IS this protocol's real pre-execution
intent object: an agent signs `{intent_type, intended_state_hash, nonce, ...}`
*before* acting, and `bcc_middleware` gates on it at `POST /v1/bcc/intercept`.
What was missing is the connective tissue between that commitment and this
SDK's observability layer (`telemetry/tracing.py`'s `trace_run`/`traceable`):
there was no span emitted when an intent was committed, no correlation ID
tying that commitment to the `trace_run` produced by the execution that
followed it, and no automated check for whether execution actually matched
what was committed to.

Two research passes (2026-07-11) informed this module's design:
  1. Span/schema design: reuse OTel's `gen_ai.*` execution-span conventions
     as-is (already done — see `telemetry/tracing.py`/`conventions.py`);
     intent needs a NEW, first-class span type, emitted synchronously
     *before* execution, since the whole point of a pre-execution gate is
     that it can't depend on data that hasn't happened yet.
  2. Behavioral-metrics design: plan-vs-execution comparison should be
     TIERED by cost — tier 1 (deterministic structural diff: tool name +
     normalized args) computed inline, tier 2 (semantic similarity) and
     tier 3 (LLM-judge) only escalated to on a tier-1 mismatch, sampled.
     This module implements tier 1 only; tiers 2/3 are a documented,
     deliberately-deferred follow-on (see `compare_planned_to_actual`'s
     docstring) — this codebase's own existing preference (fail-closed OPA,
     ZK proofs over trusting an opaque scorer) argues for shipping the
     deterministic tier first and treating a judge as calibration, not gate.

Deliberately NOT a replacement for anything: `bcc.build_bcc_commitment` is
still the single source of truth for commitment construction/signing/
canonicalization; this module only adds observability (a span + a
`trace_run`-shaped record riding the same pipeline `client._record_trace_run`
already drains) and an optional post-hoc adherence check around it.

    the same value without this SDK inventing a second ID space.
