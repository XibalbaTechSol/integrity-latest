"""
Derives the four Agent Integrity Score input signals (entropy, grounding,
sacrifice, compliance) from a batch of telemetry entries, for the SDK to
attach to a `POST /v1/telemetry/ingest` call (see
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's telemetry ingestion section).

Ownership boundary (load-bearing, see scoring-core/src/lib.rs's own module
docstring): this file produces the AIS formula's *inputs*, never the score
itself. integrity-oracle's `scoring-core` crate remains the only place the
weighted-sum formula is computed; every function here is documented as a
first-pass heuristic the SDK can compute client-side, which the oracle may
combine with its own server-side signals (verified GPU-hours, ZK
attestation state) rather than trust blindly.

All four signals are normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]` with a consistent polarity:
**1.0 always means "best/most trustworthy"**, 0.0 always means "worst" — this
matches the AIS formula's own S_entropy/S_grounding/S_sacrifice/S_compliance
polarity (see scoring-core's `AisComponentInputs` field docs: "higher is
better" for all four axes), so a caller never has to remember that one
signal is inverted relative to the others.

Every entry in `batch` is a plain dict, one per `IntegrityClient.log_telemetry`
call — see client.py for the exact shape (`metadata`, optional pre-computed
`entropy`/`grounding`). This module doesn't depend on client.py to avoid a
circular import; client.py imports this one.

# string that round-trips back to this exact f64" — but when a float has TWO
# equally-short round-tripping representations, Python's repr (David Gay) and
# Rust's ryu are each free to pick a different one. Nothing is wrong with
# either; they simply disagree, the canonical bytes differ, and Ed25519
# verification fails on a payload that was signed perfectly correctly.
#
# Confirmed against the live oracle, not theorised: a real derived entropy of
# 0.011890908425879365 failed every time while 0.009712883245855508 passed,
# and in Python BOTH "0.011890908425879365" and "0.011890908425879366"
# round-trip to that identical f64 (hex 0x1.85a42b6789780p-7) — the exact
# two-candidate ambiguity above. The oracle's error surfaced as a confusing
# "eip191 verification error: signature must be 65 bytes, got 64", which is a
# downstream red herring: `crypto::verify_agent_signature` tries Ed25519
# first, gets `false` (not an error), and falls through to the EIP-191 branch,
# which then chokes on a 64-byte Ed25519 signature.
#
# The ambiguity is a ~17-significant-digit phenomenon; at 6 decimal places the
# shortest round-tripping representation is unique, so both languages
# necessarily agree. 6dp is also far more precision than these heuristics
# justify (see each derive_* docstring — they are first-pass client-side
# estimates the oracle independently recomputes anyway), so nothing of value
# is lost by quantizing.
#
# NOTE (real remaining gap, deliberately not papered over): this only fixes the
# floats the SDK itself generates. A caller passing an arbitrary float through
# `log_telemetry(metadata=...)` can still land on an ambiguous value and hit
# the same rejection, since that value is signed verbatim inside `otel_spans`.
# The general fix is a shared canonicalization standard with a fully specified
# number format on both sides -- RFC 8785 (JCS) mandates ECMAScript's
# Number::toString, which is deterministic -- rather than each language's own
# shortest-repr. Flagged in PRODUCTION_GAPS.md rather than silently assumed
# away, same as bcc.py's own canonicalization docstring does for a related
# non-ASCII concern.
