"""
Custom metrics API.

The Agent Integrity Score (AIS) formula is fixed by
docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md §4.3 — `entropy/grounding/sacrifice/compliance`
with pinned default weights — and is computed *only* by
`integrity-oracle/scoring-core`. This SDK does not, and must not,
recompute AIS locally (every other package calls the oracle's
`/v1/agent/{id}/ais` endpoint rather than each reimplementing the formula).

But agents/operators routinely want to track other numbers alongside that —
p99 tool latency, retry counts, a task-specific quality score, whatever —
without waiting for the oracle's scoring formula to grow a new dimension
every time someone needs one. This module is the escape hatch: an
open-ended, named-metric recording API. Recorded values are aggregated
client-side and attached to the outgoing telemetry envelope under
`custom_metrics`, alongside (never mixed into) the fixed AIS inputs.
Whether/how integrity-oracle scores on `custom_metrics` is explicitly out of
scope here — that's separate, not-yet-decided oracle-side work. Our job is
only to capture and transmit them reliably.
