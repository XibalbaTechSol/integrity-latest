"""
Agent-side on-chain client: funding, direct contract deployment, and
primitive registration against the Integrity Protocol contracts.

This is the agent's own equivalent of what `bcc_middleware/app/chain.py` +
`anchor.py` already do for the *middleware's* signer — real web3.py
transactions against whatever EVM node `RPC_URL` points at, no mocked
transport. The difference is whose key signs: bcc_middleware signs as the
protocol's own anchor/oracle signer; every function below (except
`fund_agent_wallet`/`mint_testnet_itk`, which are explicitly the funder
wallet's actions) signs as the *agent's own* wallet (see wallet.py) — that
distinction is the entire point of the self-sovereign registration model
documented in docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's "Agent Primitives" section: an
agent's identity/anchor contracts are deployed by a transaction the agent
itself signed, not one the protocol signed on its behalf.
