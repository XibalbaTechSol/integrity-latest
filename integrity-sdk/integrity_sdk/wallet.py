"""
EVM (secp256k1) wallet module for the Integrity Protocol SDK.

This is deliberately a SEPARATE keypair from did.py's Ed25519 identity key,
not a re-derivation of it. The DID key proves "which agent said this" for
off-chain BCC commitments and telemetry signatures (§4.1/§4.2); the EVM key
proves "which wallet deployed/controls this agent's on-chain primitives" —
per docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md's "Agent Primitives" section, the whole point
of self-sovereign registration is that the agent's OWN wallet signs the
SovereignAgent/StateAnchor deployment transactions, so that deployment-time
signature is real, independently-verifiable proof of control. Mixing the two
key types (e.g. reusing the Ed25519 seed as an EVM private key) would also be
cryptographically wrong: EVM/secp256k1 keys and Ed25519 keys are different
curves with different scalar validity ranges, there is no safe bit-for-bit
reuse between them.

Storage posture is intentionally stronger than did.py's plain PEM: this key
signs real value-bearing transactions (contract deploys, ITK transfers), so
it's persisted as an Ethereum V3 encrypted keystore (the same format
MetaMask/geth use) rather than plaintext, gated by a password the caller must
supply out-of-band (INTEGRITY_WALLET_PASSWORD) rather than a convenience
default.
