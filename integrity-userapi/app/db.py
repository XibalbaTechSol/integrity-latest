"""
Postgres access layer -- raw asyncpg + hand-written SQL, no ORM.

Chosen to match integrity-oracle's sqlx style (hand-written, runtime SQL
over a connection pool) rather than SQLAlchemy, so this package's DB layer
stays as thin and inspectable as the oracle's `db.rs`. See README.md
"Design choices" for the full rationale.

`run_migrations` is a small hand-rolled equivalent of oracle's
`sqlx::migrate!`: it applies every `*.sql` file in migrations/ in filename
order, exactly once, tracked in a `schema_migrations` table, each inside its
own transaction.
