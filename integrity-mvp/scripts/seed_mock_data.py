"""
Seeds the currently-configured chain + integrity-oracle with a handful of
REAL registered test agents (and one real market) so integrity-mvp's UI
pages have something to render during local dev/testing, instead of
showing empty states everywhere.

This is deliberately NOT a "write fake rows into Postgres" script. Per this
repo's "no silent mocks" rule (see root CLAUDE.md), everything this script
creates is a real on-chain registration/market — the same
fund->deploy->registerPrimitives->oracle-verify sequence a real agent goes
through (via integrity_sdk.registration.register_agent), just run
repeatedly for a handful of throwaway test identities. Nothing here is
faked; it's genuinely-registered test data.

Must be run with integrity-sdk's own venv Python (this script imports
integrity_sdk as a library, it does not vendor any of its logic):

    cd integrity-sdk && uv run python ../integrity-mvp/scripts/seed_mock_data.py

Requires MOCK=true in the environment as an explicit safety rail -- this
prevents ever accidentally running this against a shared/production
deployment by muscle memory. Also requires FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY (the
protocol's testnet funder wallet) and INTEGRITY_WALLET_PASSWORD (gates the
new test agents' local EVM keystores), same as `agent register` in
integrity-cli / `make demo`.
